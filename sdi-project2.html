<p> After my night out, my girls were anxious to hear about my date. I couldn't wait to give them details aboout the great drinks they had at this night club. The only negative thing about the night was that we may have spent a lot on drinks. The night club was very high maintenence and we did order Martinis, but they were so delicious! Also, the bartenders were really friendly. This part of my date was very "colorful."</p>
