<p>What an awesome date! My friends are bugging me for details so I decided to spill everything over some wine and cheese. When we arrived at the club we went straight to the bar for a few martinis. Then we headed straight to the dancefloor. It just so happened that David knew the DJ so we asked if he could play a few songs for us before the night ends.  </p>
<p>You may also use this space to explain any elements of your code story that may not be entirely clear.  For example, if your theme is thirteenth century Italian poetry, not everyone may be familiar with that.</p>
<p>Don't forget to replace all of the capitalized elements in this template with your information.  Your term number should be in a <em>yymm</em> format, including the year and the month.</p>
