<p>My story is simple and it is an extension from my last story. It takes place a year later. Basically my boyfriend and I went on a date and after that had been together ever since and he is plannning a surprise proposal.</p>
<p>All of my elements were self explanitory. My code is not complex so there were not many elements that needed further explanation. </p>
